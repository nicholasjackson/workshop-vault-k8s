# Static Secrets Overview

Static secrets are key-value pairs stored in Vault's KV secrets engine. These are secrets that don't change automatically - they remain constant until manually updated.

## Use Cases

Static secrets are ideal for:

- API keys
- Configuration values
- Certificates
- Any secret that doesn't need automatic rotation

## KV Secrets Engine

Vault's KV (Key-Value) secrets engine stores arbitrary secrets. Version 2 (kv-v2) provides:

- Secret versioning
- Soft delete and recovery
- Metadata tracking

## Demo Secret

During setup, we created a demo secret at `secret/demo/config`:

```bash
vault kv get secret/demo/config
```

This contains:
- `username` - A demo username
- `password` - A demo password
- `api_key` - A demo API key

## VaultStaticSecret Resource

The Vault Secrets Operator uses `VaultStaticSecret` custom resources to sync KV secrets to Kubernetes. In the next pages, we'll configure authentication and create a VaultStaticSecret to sync our demo secret.
