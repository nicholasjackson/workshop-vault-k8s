# Environment Setup

## Export Environment Variables

First, export the environment variables for your shell:

```bash
eval $(jumppad env)
```

This sets up:
- `KUBECONFIG` - Path to the Kubernetes configuration
- `VAULT_ADDR` - Vault server address (http://localhost:8200)
- `VAULT_TOKEN` - Root token for Vault (root)

## Configure Vault

Run the setup script to configure Vault with Kubernetes authentication:

```bash
./scripts/setup-vault.sh
```

This script:
1. Creates a demo secret at `secret/demo/config`
2. Enables the Kubernetes authentication method
3. Creates a token reviewer service account for Vault
4. Configures a policy and role for the demo application

## Verify the Setup

Check that Vault is accessible:

```bash
vault status
```

Verify the Kubernetes cluster is running:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

Check that the Vault Secrets Operator is running:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n vault-secrets-operator
```

## Next Steps

With the environment configured, you're ready to start working with secrets!
